        <ul>
            <li><strong>On your device:</strong> Your journal entries are stored locally on your iPhone or iPad using Apple's secure data storage.</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>iCloud Sync</h2>
        <p>When you enable iCloud sync:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your data syncs directly between your devices through your personal iCloud account</li>
            <li>Apple manages this sync using CloudKit</li>
            <li>We have no access to your iCloud data</li>
            <li>You can disable sync at any time in the app settings</li>

        <h2>Notifications</h2>
        <p>If you enable reminders, the app uses Apple's local notification system. These notifications are scheduled and managed entirely on your device. No notification data is sent to us or any third party.</p>

        <h2>No Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>My Heart Log does not connect to any external services. There are no analytics, no advertising, and no tracking of any kind.</p>
